# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Using [city_data.csv](https://github.com/borkard/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources/city_data.csv) and [ride_data.csv](https://github.com/borkard/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources/ride_data.csv), an analysis was conducted with Pandas and Python to determine the Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per Driver per type of city. After creating a summary view of the ride-sharing data by city type, Matplotlib was used to create a multiple-line plot to show the total weekly fares for each type of city.

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
