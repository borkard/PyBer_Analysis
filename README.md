# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
An analysis of ride-sharing data and city-data was conducted to 


V. Isualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

Using [city_data.csv]([city_data.csv](https://github.com/borkard/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources/city_data.csv)) and [ride_data.csv]([ride_data.csv](https://github.com/borkard/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources/ride_data.csv))

## Results
Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
